    <img src="pearz.png" alt="Piers Mana's avatar, a emojified green pear" />
    <p>My name is Piers, and I'm working on a bunch of stuff:</p>
    <section>
      <h2 style="color:green">Health</h2>
      <p>I am writing "The O.N.E. Ways," a mixed-media book about transforming habits using assistive technology.</p>
      <p>The mission is to improve my and, by extension, the world's mental health.</p>
      <p>My goal is to develop a programmatic approach to personal growth because I believe every individual has individual needs that require continual discovery.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 style="color:red">Wealth</h2>
      <p>I am fundraising for Aloha!, a wireless connectivity project based in Santa Cruz, CA</p>
      <p>The mission is to create internet equity in our community.</p>
      <p>My goal is to create a scalable network of devices serving free Wi-Fi because I believe access to online tools and information is a human right.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 style="color:blue">Courage</h2>
      <p>I am attended the <a href="polymer-project.org">Polymer Summit</a>, a Google conference in Copenhagen, Denmark</p>
      <p>Their mission is to improve the internet experience for users and developers.</p>
      <p>My goal is to accelerate adoption of web components because I believe they are the near and future patterns of technology design.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 style="color:black">Kindfulness</h2>
      <p>I am volunteering at the <a href="homelessgardenproject.org">Homeless Garden Project</a>, a not-for-profit organization based in Santa Cruz, CA</p>
      <p>Their mission is to provide job training and other tools to people transitioning from homelessness.</p>
      <p>My goal is to assist people in using technology for job seeking and job skills because I believe everyone deserves economic opportunity.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 style="color:purple">Input</h2>
      <p>I am reading a whitepaper for <a href="https://github.com/the-laughing-monkey/cicada-platform/blob/master/Cicada-WhitePaper-2016-10.13.GA.1.pdf">Cicada</a>, an open-source project on Github.</p>
      <p>Their mission is to end the cycle of power-driven violence and consolidation of leadership through Distributed Direct Democracy.</p>
      <p>My goal is to understand the networking and security concepts used in their blockchain concept because I believe distributed computing has high-impact opportunities yet to be discovered.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 style="color:gold">Output</h2>
      <p>I am developing a website for the <a href="yogaforallmovement.org">Yoga For All Movement</a>, a not-for-profit organization based in Santa Cruz, CA</p>
      <p>Their mission is to bring the practice of trauma-informed yoga to, well, ALL, focusing on at-risk populations such as those in jail, prison, juvenile hall, and women's centers.</p>
      <p>My goal is to help grow a volunteer base, receive funding from donors, and host resources for the community because I believe yoga heals.</p>

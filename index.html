    <h1>Aloha!</h1>
    <p>My name is Piers, and I'm working on a bunch of stuff:</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Health</h2>
      <p>I am growing a lifestyle for a healthy brain</p>
      <p>The mission is to improve the world's mental health through accessible practices, resources, and support.</p>
      <p>My goal is to become the happiest version of myself because I believe embodying joy radiates joy.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Wealth</h2>
      <p>I am working for <a href="hospitalitypulse.com">Hospitality Pulse</a>, a technology company based in Santa Cruz, CA</p>
      <p>Our mission is to streamline hotel operations, in particular room assignment, to maximize value for the house and reduce negative guest experiences.</p>
      <p>My goal is to develop a harmonious connection between users and AI because I believe systems should help people instead of getting in the way.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Courage</h2>
      <p>I am attending the <a href="polymer-project.org">Polymer Summit</a>, a Google conference in Copenhagen, Denmark</p>
      <p>Their mission is to make life better for users and developers, by helping developers unlock the web platformâ€™s full potential and by spurring the web platform to evolve and improve.</p>
      <p>My goal is to familiarize myself with web components because I believe they are the future pattern of technology design.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Kindfulness</h2>
      <p>I am volunteering at the <a href="homelessgardenproject.org">Homeless Garden Project</a>, a not-for-profit organization based in Santa Cruz, CA</p>
      <p>Their mission is to provide job training and other tools to people who are working to end their homelessness.</p>
      <p>My goal is to assist people in using technology for job seeking and job skills because I believe doing so helps me grow as a teacher and as a person.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Input</h2>
      <p>I am reading a whitepaper for <a href="https://github.com/the-laughing-monkey/cicada-platform/blob/master/Cicada-WhitePaper-2016-10.13.GA.1.pdf">Cicada</a>, an open-source project on Github.</p>
      <p>Their mission is to end the cycle of power-driven violence and consolidation of leadership through Distributed Direct Democracy.</p>
      <p>My goal is to understand the networking and security concepts used in their blockchain concept because I believe distributed computing needs to be mainstreamed.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Output</h2>
      <p>I am developing a new website for the <a href="yogaforallmovement.org">Yoga For All Movement</a>, a not-for-profit organization based in Santa Cruz, CA</p>
      <p>Their mission is to bring the practice of trauma-informed yoga to, well, ALL, first focusing on at-risk populations such as those in jail, prison, juvenile hall, and women's centers.</p>
      <p>My goal is to help grow a volunteer base, receive funding from donors, and host resources for the community because I believe yoga heals.</p>
